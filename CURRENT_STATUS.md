# Current Status - OpenAI Hackathon Concept MRI

## Where We Are
We were in the middle of setting up the GPT-OSS-20B model for the Concept MRI project when Claude froze and we had to restart.

## What We've Accomplished
- ✅ GPU available: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti (15.9 GB)
- ✅ Python 3.10.12 working with required ML packages installed:
  - torch 2.8.0
  - transformers 4.56.1 
  - bitsandbytes 0.47.0
  - accelerate 1.10.1
- ✅ Original GPT-OSS-20B model downloaded (~13GB in data/models/gpt-oss-20b/)
- ✅ Multiple test scripts created in scripts/ directory
- ✅ WSL .wslconfig file created to allocate 24GB memory

## ✅ RESOLVED: Model is Working!
GPT-OSS-20B is now successfully running with MXFP4 quantization directly on the RTX 5070 Ti GPU.
- Model loads in ~5 seconds
- Inference is working correctly
- Using quantized model (no dequantization needed)
- Memory usage: ~14GB GPU allocation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **✅ Model Loading**: Working with `python3 scripts/test_quantized_model.py`
2. **Next: Implement MoE routing capture hooks**
3. **Build the probe capture service** for Concept Trajectory Analysis

## Files Ready to Use
- `scripts/dequantize_model.py` - Converts MXFP4 to BF16 (memory limits adjusted for WSL)
- `scripts/test_model_loading_fixed.py` - Tests model loading with RTX 5070 Ti optimizations
- `backend/requirements.txt` - All dependencies specified
- `architecture.yaml` - Project architecture tracking

## Goal
Get the dequantized GPT-OSS-20B model working so we can:
1. Implement MoE routing capture hooks
2. Build the probe capture service for Concept Trajectory Analysis
3. Continue with the hackathon demo workflows

## Memory Configuration
- Requested: 24GB in .wslconfig 
- Currently available: ~16GB (needs WSL restart)
- GPU: 15.9GB VRAM available
